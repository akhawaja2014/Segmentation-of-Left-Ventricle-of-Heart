\begin_layout Abstract
Left Ventricle is an integral part of the heart.
 It pumps blood into the body.
 Cardiovascular diseaes are quite common in modern world.
 The health of the heart can be studied using left ventricle.
 Most of the heart diseases can be diagnosed by retrieving important information
 from systole and diastole operations of heart via effective medical imaging
 analysis of Left Ventricle (LV).
 The segmentation of Left Ventricle plays an important role in retrieving
 the ejection fraction (a parameter which indicates the heart's health).
 Since Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) are noisy and not really perfect,
 scientific community is always curious to find more effecient, reliable,
 robust and more accurate segmentation methods to calculate ejection fraction.
 In this research project, we use a novel hybrid approach for segmentation.
 K-means, along with border following algorithm is used for segmentation.
 The results are quite impressive and discussed in the last section.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The segmentation of left ventricle is of utmost importance when it come
 to diagnosis of heart diseases.
 It takes too much of a time for manual segmentation and is a painstaking
 task.
 This segmentation establishes and provides us with important knowledge
 of critical parameters which can help us calculate certain ratios.
 These ratios help doctors to predict the condition of heart and in some
 cases diagnose a particular disease.
 In short, an efficeint segmentation of heart ends up saving patient life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately doctors are too busy to manually segment each of the medical
 image and it also wastes alot of thier time.
 They are more needed to patients.
 There is an inevitable demand for some automatic segmentation of left ventricle.
 Alot of work has been done in this field, but because medical images are
 not really the most perfect images, segmentation algorithms are destined
 to struggle with accuracy.
 Some of the most common methods used for demonstrated in figure

We went through the algorithms and decided to use Hybrid Appoach for our
 segmentation.
 In hybrid approach, we intend to use more than one approaches / algorithms
 to work simaltaneosly on the segmentation of the image.
 In this project we used mainly primarily K-Means algorithm inspired by

.
 Alongside, a border following algorithm inspired from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 was used to enhance segmentation results.
 The preproccessing was done with adaptive smoothing algorithm.
 Finally we optimized the performance of our algorithm by repeated experiments
 of using the algorithm with different datasets and setting the parameters
 to optimal value.

Anatomy of Heart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heart is made up of four chambers: two upper chambers known as the left
 atrium and right atrium and two lower chambers called the left and right
 ventricles.
 These are shown in following figure .

The left ventricle is considered an important part of the cardiovascular
 system.
 It is thought off as a pump that supplies blood to the body.
 The mass of the left ventricle, as estimated by magnetic resonance imaging,
 averages 
\begin_inset Formula $143g±38.4g$
\end_inset

, with a range of 
\begin_inset Formula $87–224g$

\begin_layout Standard
Another important thing to discuss are the two phases of the cardiac cycle.
 They are called Systole and Diastole.
 They occur as the heart beats, pumping blood through a system of blood
 vessels that carry blood to every part of the body.
 Systole occurs when the heart contracts to pump blood out, and diastole
 occurs when the heart relaxes after contraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ejection Fraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ejection fraction (EF) refers to how well your left ventricle (or right
 ventricle) pumps blood with each heart beat 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lynch2006automatic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The ejection fraction can be calculated as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{EF}=\frac{V_{\mathrm{endo}}\left(t_{\mathrm{D}}\right)-V_{\mathrm{endo}}(t\mathrm{s})}{V_{\mathrm{endo}}\left(t_{\mathrm{D}}\right)}\label{eq:-9}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here note that 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{endo}$
\end_inset

 is the volume of the inner walls of the heart, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{endo}(t_{D})=max_{t}[V_{endo}(t)]$
\end_inset

 is the end-diastolic volume and
\begin_inset Formula $V_{endo}(t_{S})=min_{t}[V_{endo}(t)]$
\end_inset

 is the end-systolic volume.

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first task was to identify the tasks in the project.
 After we were done with identifying the tasks, we came to their implementation
 on python.
 We studied and learned to use the needed libraries in python.
 The libraries hae been given in Appendix A.
 The following flowchart gives a very articulate work flow

Development
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we will discuss the implementation of algorithm.
 Python programming language was used for the implementation.
 The methodology from figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 was observed to complete the project.
 We faced challenges in almost every stage but our resiliance and motivation
 kept us going.
 The following subsections take us step by step through the ladder of project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adaptive non linear smoothing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We considered Feature-Preserving Adaptive Smoothing Method (FPASM) for our
 project.
 The primary K-Means research 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 that we were following took this algorithm from another research 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Adaptive smoothing is a class of typical nonlinear smoothing techniques
 that has been studied for many years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea is to adapt pixel intensities to the local attributes of an image
 on the basis of discontinuity measures.
 Note that in this algorithm there are two kind of discontinuities, Local
 and Contextual discontinuity.
 This novel approach joins these both discontinuities to preserve edges
 and at same time smooths images.
 It is brilliant method according to us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to measure local discontinuities, we define four detectors for
 pixel 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)$
\end_inset

 along four directions.
 These four directions are vertical (V), horizontal (H), diagonal (D), and
 counter-diagonal (C), respectively.
 Accordingly, four detectors are defined as

In order to detect contextual discontinuities, we use spatial variance to
 make a measure.
 First, we define a contextual neighborhood associated with pixel

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, here 
\begin_inset Formula $R(R>1)$
\end_inset

 is a parameter that determines the size of this contextual neighborhood.
 The contextual neighborhood is defined here without explicitly counting
 image boundaries.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 describes a spatial scale or a resolution that critically determines results
 of the contextual discontinuity measure.
 We calculate the mean of pixels on

Interpretation of ch results

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

So, these results reccomend us that the local attributes of a pixel with
 a high contextual discontinuity should be preserved and those of a pixel
 with a low contextual discontinuity should be smoothed toward homogeneity.
 However, both noise and trivial features irrelevant to a given problem
 lead to the complexity for visual information processing.
 In order to reduce their influence in the contextual discontinuity estimation,
 we introduce a transformation into 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}_{xy}^{2}(R)$

\tilde{\sigma}_{xy}^{2}(R) & \tilde{\sigma}_{xy}^{2}(R)\geq\theta_{\sigma}

 For a given 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\sigma},\Phi\left(\tilde{\sigma}_{\pi v}^{2}(R),\theta_{\sigma}\right)$
\end_inset

 gives us lead to contextual discontinuity map.In summary, pixels of same
 area or region are supposed to have low contextual discontinuities except
 the case, for those pixels located near boundaries that have high contextual
 discontinuities.
 Unlike local discontinuity measure, conextual discontinuity measure is
 relatively insensitive to local intensity changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have established the concepts of Local Discontinuity and Contextual
 discontinuity, It is easier to understand the smoothing algorithm.
 The key concept of adaptive smoothing is to update a pixel’s intensity
 through the influence of local weighted averaging of its neighboring pixels’
 intensities.

Detection of Region of Interest (ROI)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a trickiest part of the project.
 We tried a number of approaches to detect the region of interest, i.e the
 region containing left ventricle and its nearby surroundings.
 The approaches have been defined described briefly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hough Transform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know that the left ventricle can thought of as an approximation of circle.
 Hough transform is used to detect circular features in an image.
 We applied hough transform and detected ventricle.
 With the centre of ventricle detected as centre of circle, we declared
 the reasonable area around centre of circle as region of interest.
 However this approach was not a great idea because:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Left ventricle is the only circular shape object in image, Many slices had
 more than one circular object other than left ventricle which allowed it
 hough transform to detect false left ventricle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In some images / slices, left ventricle becomes too dark to be detected
 as an object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In some images / slices, the left ventricle is not near to circular shape.
 so hough transform fails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on these reasons, we decided to go for another approach.
\end_layout

Segmentation of Left Ventricle

\begin_layout Standard
A border following algorithm inspired by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 was used to segment Left Ventricle.
 Border following is one of the most important and popular technique in
 segmentation of binary images.
 .
 It derives a sequence of the coordinates or the chain codes from the border
 between a connected component of l-pixels
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Pixels with densities 1 are called the 1-pixel
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (l-component)’ and a connected component of O-pixels
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Pixels with densities 0 are called the O-pixel
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (background or hole).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea of border following algorithm is simple.
 It works on binary image and already produced binary image by 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 (2 clusters) with 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering.
 The border following algorithm as illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-simple-"

\end_inset

 sees th component as 1 and background as 0.
 When it moves through the pixel grid passing each pixel watching out their
 intensity (0 or 1).
 As soon as it observes a jump from O-Pixel to 1-Pixel, it memorizes the
 pixel location and value.
 After it memorizes

\begin_layout Plain Layout
By memorize we mean it saves the pixel location in a vector
\end_layout

\end_inset

 all the jumps i.e switching from O-Pixel to 1-Pixel and vice versa, It categoriz
es the the border in number of objects depending whether the pixel locations
 are connected to each other or they are sparsely located.
